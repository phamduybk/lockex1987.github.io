      <h3>Life of a programmer.</h3>
      <p>Have you ever ask yourself: "What is the purpose of your life?"</p>
      <p>I've spent almost haft of my life, and I still asking me the same
        question.</p>
      <p>My career is programmer. So I focus on "life of a programmer".</p>
      <p>I think create a useful software that people use it happily is a
        successful. NoMoney (Not Only Money :). Of course you must have money to
        live, but that is not the most important thing.</p>
      <p>Earn money honestly and honorably.</p>
      <p>Some people say that freelancers sell their value cheaply. Is it true?</p>
      <p>I don't like to create some trivial applications like some games (or
        some trivial songs like "Gangnam style"). I don't criticize them, I just
        don't like them. They rise and gone.</p>
      <p>I want some useful application like 'Pharmacy sale support system' for
        my sister.</p>
      <p>I think freelance is an interesting idea. Free to do anything. If you
        works hard, you will earn more (you gain for you pain). No one manages
        you, ask you to do this or to do that. No pressure, no stress. Every new
        day is different from other. It's fun (or scared :) ) experience.</p>
      <p>WORK WITH PASSION! NEVER GIVE UP!</p>
      <p>Different company, different technology.</p>
      <p>One compay. one technology.</p>
      <p>Learn and work hard -&gt; skilled programmer.</p>
      <p>Try not to become a man of success, but try to become a man of value -
        Einstein.</p>
      <p>Chase the perfect, success will chase you - 3 idiots.</p>
