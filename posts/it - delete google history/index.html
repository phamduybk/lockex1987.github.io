   <h1>Delete searches &amp; browsing activity</h1> 
   <p>Your searches and browsing activity are saved in your Web &amp; App Activity when it's turned on and you're signed in to your Google Account. You're in control of what's saved, and you can delete it or turn the setting off whenever you like.</p> 
   <h4>Delete items one at a time</h4> 
   <ol> 
    <li>Visit the <a href="https://history.google.com/history/?utm_source=help" target="_blank">Web &amp; App Activity</a> page. You may be asked to sign in to your Google Account.</li> 
    <li>Check the box next to the item you want to delete. You can delete an entire day of items by checking the box next to a date.</li> 
    <li>At the top of the page, select <strong>Delete</strong>.</li> 
   </ol> 
   <h4>Delete all of your history</h4>

   <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to delete items from a specific date, select the calendar at the top of the page to find the date you want.</p> 
   <p>This is very dangerous. You should pause all history in the same page.</p>
