# Router - History API

This is basically equivalent to [Page Switcher example](../router-page-switcher/), but it uses HTML5 history API.

## Set up your server

You need to set up your server ([Express](http://expressjs.com/) or anything) to redirect all to `index.html`. You can also try it with `superstatic`. Just write [superstatic.json](superstatic.json) like this.

## Have a play

This demo is not available on Plunker.

## Run locally

Install superstatic if you don't have.

```bash
$ npm install -g superstatic
```

Download or clone this repo, then run the command.

```bash
$ cd to/this/dir
$ superstatic
```
