    <h2>JavaScript &amp; CSS Scaffolding</h2>
    <p>While Laravel does not dictate which JavaScript or CSS pre-processors you
      use, it does provide a basic starting point using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
      and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> that will be helpful for many
      applications. By default, Laravel uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">NPM</a>
      to install both of these frontend packages.</p>
    <p><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix">Laravel Mix</a> provides a
      clean, expressive API over compiling SASS or Less, which are extensions of
      plain CSS that add variables, mixins, and other powerful features that
      make working with CSS much more enjoyable. In this document, we will
      briefly discuss CSS compilation in general; however, you should consult
      the full <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix">Laravel Mix
        documentation</a> for more information on compiling SASS or Less.</p>
    <p>Laravel does not require you to use a specific JavaScript framework or
      library to build your applications. In fact, you don't have to use
      JavaScript at all. However, Laravel does include some basic scaffolding to
      make it easier to get started writing modern JavaScript using the <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>
      library. Vue provides an expressive API for building robust JavaScript
      applications using components. As with CSS, we may use Laravel Mix to
      easily compile JavaScript components into a single, browser-ready
      JavaScript file.</p>
    <p>If you would like to remove the frontend scaffolding from your
      application, you may use the <code>preset</code> Artisan command. This
      command, when combined with the <code>none</code> option, will remove the
      Bootstrap and Vue scaffolding from your application, leaving only a blank
      SASS file and a few common JavaScript utility libraries:</p>
    <pre><code>php artisan preset none</code></pre>
    <h3>Writing CSS</h3>
    <p>Laravel's <code>package.json</code> file includes the <code>bootstrap</code>
      package to help you get started prototyping your application's frontend
      using Bootstrap. However, feel free to add or remove packages from the <code>package.json</code>
      file as needed for your own application. You are not required to use the
      Bootstrap framework to build your Laravel application - it is provided as
      a good starting point for those who choose to use it.</p>
    <p>Before compiling your CSS, install your project's frontend dependencies
      using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">Node package manager (NPM)</a>:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
    <p>Once the dependencies have been installed using <code>npm install</code>,
      you can compile your SASS files to plain CSS using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix#working-with-stylesheets">Laravel
        Mix</a>. The <code>npm run dev</code> command will process the
      instructions in your <code>webpack.mix.js</code>
      file. Typically, your compiled CSS will be placed in the <code>public/css</code>
      directory:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run dev</code></pre>
    <p>The default <code>webpack.mix.js</code>
      included with Laravel will compile the <code>resources/sass/app.scss</code>
      SASS file. This <code>app.scss</code> file imports a file of
      SASS variables and loads Bootstrap, which provides a good starting point
      for most applications. Feel free to customize the <code>app.scss</code>
      file however you wish or even use an entirely different pre-processor by <a
        href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix">configuring Laravel Mix</a>.</p>
    <h3>Writing JavaScript</h3>
    <p>All of the JavaScript dependencies required by your application can be
      found in the <code>package.json</code> file in the project's
      root directory. This file is similar to a <code>composer.json</code>
      file except it specifies JavaScript dependencies instead of PHP
      dependencies. You can install these dependencies using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">Node
        package manager (NPM)</a>:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p> By default, the Laravel <code>package.json</code> file
      includes a few packages such as <code>vue</code> and <code>axios</code>
      to help you get started building your JavaScript application. Feel free to
      add or remove from the <code>package.json</code> file as
      needed for your own application.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Once the packages are installed, you can use the <code>npm run dev</code>
      command to <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix">compile your assets</a>.
      Webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When you
      run the <code>npm run dev</code> command, Webpack will execute the
      instructions in your <code>webpack.mix.js</code>
      file:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run dev</code></pre>
    <p>By default, the Laravel <code>webpack.mix.js</code>
      file compiles your SASS and the <code>resources/js/app.js</code>file.
      Within the <code>app.js</code> file you may register your
      Vue components or, if you prefer a different framework, configure your own
      JavaScript application. Your compiled JavaScript will typically be placed
      in the <code>public/js</code> directory.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> The <code>app.js</code> file will load the <code>resources/js/bootstrap.js</code>
      file which bootstraps and configures Vue, Axios, jQuery, and all other
      JavaScript dependencies. If you have additional JavaScript dependencies to
      configure, you may do so in this file.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Writing Vue Components</h4>
    <p>By default, fresh Laravel applications contain an <code>ExampleComponent.vue</code>
      Vue component located in the <code>resources/js/components</code>
      directory. The <code>ExampleComponent.vue</code> file is an
      example of a <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/single-file-components">single
        file Vue component</a> which defines its JavaScript and HTML template in
      the same file. Single file components provide a very convenient approach
      to building JavaScript driven applications. The example component is
      registered in your <code>app.js</code> file:</p>
    <pre><code>Vue.component(
    'example-component',
    require('./components/ExampleComponent.vue')
);</code></pre>
    <p>To use the component in your application, you may drop it into one of
      your HTML templates. For example, after running the <code>make:auth</code>
      Artisan command to scaffold your application's authentication and
      registration screens, you could drop the component into the <code>home.blade.php</code>
      Blade template:</p>
    <pre><code>@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    &lt;example-component&gt;&lt;/example-component&gt;
@endsection</code></pre>
    <p></p>
    <p> Remember, you should run the <code>npm run dev</code> command each time
      you change a Vue component. Or, you may run the <code>npm run watch</code>
      command to monitor and automatically recompile your components each time
      they are modified.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Of course, if you are interested in learning more about writing Vue
      components, you should read the <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/">Vue
        documentation</a>, which provides a thorough, easy-to-read overview of
      the entire Vue framework.</p>
    <h4>Using React</h4>
    <p>If you prefer to use React to build your JavaScript application, Laravel
      makes it a cinch to swap the Vue scaffolding with React scaffolding. On
      any fresh Laravel application, you may use the <code>preset</code>
      command with the <code>react</code> option:</p>
    <pre><code>php artisan preset react</code></pre>
    <p>This single command will remove the Vue scaffolding and replace it with
      React scaffolding, including an example component.</p>
