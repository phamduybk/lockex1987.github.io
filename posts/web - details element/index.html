  <details open>
    <summary>Have you heard about <code>details</code>?</summary>
    <p>It's a pretty useful element that handles accordion / collapsed text natively!</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>So how does it work?</summary>
    <p>You wrap a <code>details</code> element around any block of HTML content. The browser will collapse that block of text
      until a user opens the <code>details</code> block.</p>
    <p>Once a user opens a <code>details</code> block, they'll be able to read all that hidden content!</p>
    <p>If you want the details block open by default, set the <code>open</code> on the opening tag:</p>
    <pre><code><​details open>...<​/details></code></pre>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>But how do I set a custom title?</summary>
    <p>That's pretty manageable too! Use the <code>summary</code> element.</p>
    <p>Put a <code>summary</code> at the beginning of your details element and <b>Boom!</b> - you've got a custom title for
      your <code>details</code> block.</p>
    <p>No worries if you don't add a <code>summary</code>. The browser will put the word "Details" in there for you. (After
      all, users need something to click!)</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>That's cool, but what about styles?</summary>
    <p>Yes, you're covered there too! Style the <code>details</code> element however you like. Give it a border, some padding,
      whatever.</p>
    <p>The <code>summary</code> element is where the <code>▸</code> marker lives. If you want to get rid of that, there is a
      prefixed pseudo-element selector <code>::-webkit-details-marker</code>: set that to <code>display: none</code> for
      WebKit browser. In Firefox, it's much simpler: set the <code>summary</code> to <code>display: block</code> or <code>flex</code>      (anything but the native <code>display: list-item</code>) and you'll get rid of the <code>▸</code> for you.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Ok, ok, but what about styling based on state?</summary>
    <p>Once again, <code>details</code> has got your back! When a <code>details</code> block is open, it has the <code>open</code>      attribute that I mentioned earlier. To style it (or its children) based on its state, use <code>details[open] { }</code>.</p>
    <p>Note: there's no <code>closed</code> attribute: styles you apply by "default" will be used on the closed state.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>But this requires JavaScript, right?</summary>
    <p>Open the JS panel on this pen. Clean as a whistle! This is handled totally by the browser.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What about accessibility? Is that the catch?</summary>
    <p>Sorry to disappoint you. Since these are native HTML elements, they provide useful semantic information to screen readers.</p>
    <p>Screen readers will typically read the <code>summary</code> for a collapsed <code>details</code> block (and communicate
      that it's collapsed). They'll also provide an interactive hook for users to open the <code>details</code> block. If
      the <code>details</code> is already expanded, they'll read the whole content.</p>
    <p>I don't rely on assistive tech to read the web, so I'm probably not aware of some limitations or drawbacks to using <code>details</code>      and <code>summary</code>, but I suspect their AT UX is at least as good as (if not better than) most JavaScript-dependent
      accordion solutions.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Excellent! More information, please!</summary>
    <p>You bet! Here are some great resources on <code>details</code> &amp; <code>summary</code>:</p>

  <details>
    <summary>But what about cross-browser compatibility?</summary>
    <p>Yeah, sorry. Here's some bad news. IE, Edge, and Opera Mini don't currently support <code>details</code>/<code>summary</code>      with native open/close behavior (check out <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caniuse data for <code>details</code></a>).
      <p>
        <p>These browsers will show all your <code>details</code> elements expanded. That's not the worst though: it's a bit
          of progressive enhancement: if the browser doesn't support the native UI behavior, the content will still be visible
          to users.</p>
        <p>It's unlikey IE11 will be getting any updates on this front, but there's hope for Edge! If this is important to you,
          please <a href="https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6261266-details-summary-elements"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">cast a vote a vote for Edge to support <code>details</code>/<code>summary.</code></a>.</p>
        <p>If you do need to have open/close behavior in IE11 (or any other non-supporting browser), you'll probably need a
          polyfill. This <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/complete-polyfill-html5-details-element/" target="_blank"
