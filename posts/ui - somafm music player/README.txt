 This is a Vue.js web application for streaming radio stations from Somafm.com. This app uses the public SomaFM JSON channels API endpoint to pull in a list of stations and makes it easy to switch between stations. This app also used Three.js and the HTML5 Web Audio Context API to sample audio data and create a visualizer effect for the selected station.
