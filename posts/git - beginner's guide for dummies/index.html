     <p>Hello there! I'm Dr. Chimp, your Git tutor. Today, we will learn the basics of a distributed version control system called Git.</p> 
    </div> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">What do you do when you want to recover past versions of a file?</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">The most common way to do it is to save multiple files with different dates and file names (eg. 12-02-2014-monkey_code.php). However, this method is often cumbersome especially when we are dealing with hundreds of files, making it close to impossible to manage. </p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30 Text-center"><img src="images/0-capture_intro1_1_1.png" alt="Examples of backing up a file"></p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">Naming files randomly like the above example also makes it difficult to distinguish the later versions from earlier ones, or who they are were edited by. Most importantly, it is impossible to find out what changes have been made simply from file names. </p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">When team members are editing a file simultaneously, things may get messy and overwriting may occur. </p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30 Text-center"><img src="images/0-capture_intro1_1_2.png" alt="Failure examples while working as a team"></p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40">This is when a version control system like Git comes in handy.</p> 
    <h2>Version control with Git</h2> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">Git is a distributed version control system originally developed to manage Linux source codes.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">Using Git, you can easily view the revision history of your source code to track changes and easily go back in time to learn about the differences between different versions of your files.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">If the latest version of a file is on the shared repository, Git will prevent an unintentional overwrite by those maintaining an older version of the file. </p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40 Text-center"><img src="images/0-capture_intro1_1_3.png" alt="Examples of team works using the management of versions"></p> 
    <div class="Point Mg-b60"> 
     <p class="Mg-b10">With Git, it is unnecessary to manually backup a copy every file version (ie. saving multiple copies of your source directories). </p> 
    </div>

   <div class="Entry-content"> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">When you create a Git repository with the given files and directories, you can record their change history and start tracking their status and versions.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40 Text-center"><img src="images/1-capture_intro1_2_1.png" alt="Repository for managing the history of files and directories"></p> 
    <h2 class="Mg-b15">Remote repositories and local repositories </h2> 
    <p>There are two types of Git repositories namely a Remote repository and a Local repository.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Remote repository: Repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members.</li> 
     <li>Local repository: Repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">You can use all of Git's version control features on your local repository such as reverting changes, tracking changes, etc. However, when it comes to sharing your changes or pulling changes from your team members, that is where a remote repository comes in handy.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40 Text-center"><img src="images/1-capture_intro1_2_2.png" alt="Remote repositories and local repositories "></p> 
    <h2 class="Mg-b15">Creating a repository</h2> 
    <p>There are two ways to create a local repository on your local machine.</p> 
    <p>You can either create a brand new repository from scratch or by cloning an existing remote repository onto your local machine.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40 Text-center"><img src="images/1-capture_intro1_2_3.png" alt="How to make a repository"></p> 
    <div class="Important Mg-b60"> 
     <p>Next, I will explain the role of Commits.</p> 
    </div>

  <article class="Post" id="article2"> 
   <div class="Entry-content"> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">The "commit" operation enables you to record changes that were made to a file or directory in the Git history.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">By commiting every change made, you will be able to view all changes chronologically in the respective file or directory.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40 Text-center"><img src="images/2-capture_intro1_3_1.png" alt="Stored in the repository linked chronologically to each other"></p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">To uniquely identify a commit, a 40-character checksum hash is used as its identifier. You can use that checksum hash to retrieve the status or changes on files and directories that were made at the given commit in your repository.</p> 
    <div class="Tips Mg-b60"> 
     <p class="subhead">Tip</p> 
     <p>Separating different types of change such as bug fixes, new feature, and improvements into different sets of commits will allow you and your team members to easily understand why and how those changes were made.</p> 
    </div> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">When commiting your changes, you are required to enter a commit message. The commit message provides descriptive comments regarding the changes you have made.</p> 
    <div class="Tips Mg-b60"> 
     <p class="subhead">Tip</p> 
     <p class="Mg-b10">The commit message is important as it helps to convey the reason for a file or directory change made. It would be useful to you and your team members when revisiting those changes in future. Write commit messages that are descriptive and easy to understand. The following is a recommended structure for an effective Git commit message.</p> 
     <pre class="Mg-b10">
1st line: Abstract of the contents changed by commits
2nd line: Blank line
3rd line and the following lines: Reason for changes</pre>

   <div class="Entry-content"> 
    <p>A "working tree" consist of files that you are currently working on.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b30">An "index" is a staging area where new commits are prepared. It acts as the interface between a repository and a working tree.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b40 Text-center"><img src="images/3-capture_intro1_4_1.png" alt="Work tree and index"></p> 
    <p>Changes made on the working tree will not be commited directly to the repository. They need to be staged on the index first. All changes residing on the index will be the ones that actually get committed into the repository.</p> 
    <p class="Mg-b60">An index gives you better control on what files should be included and allows you to commit a specific part of a file staged on the index into the repository.</p> 
    <div class="Important Mg-b60">

    <h2>Mac</h2> 
    <p>After installing, open Terminal which is located in Applications/Utilities.</p> 
    <p>Let's verify that Git has been successfully installed by doing a version check. The output string may differ depending on the installed environment or the version.</p>

    <p>Now, let's set up the default username and e-mail address for Git that will be used to identify the person who commits the change. This setup only needs to be done once.</p> 
    <h2>Console</h2> 
    <p>The Git console configuration is saved in the .gitconfig file in the user's home directory. You can manually edit the file but in this tutorial we will be using the "config" command.</p>

     <p>If you use Console (Git Bash) on Windows, a file name containing non-ascii characters will be displayed in a form like "\346\226\260\350\246...". We can configure it to allow the file to display the file name as it is by doing the following.</p> 
     <pre class="Mg-b30">$ git config --global core.quotepath off</pre> 
     <p>If you use Console on Windows, you can only use ascii characters. Accordingly, if you want to include multi-byte characters in a commit message, you have to set an external editor and should not use the -m option.</p> 
     <p>External editors should be compatible with the character code UTF-8 and linefeed code LF.</p>

    <p>As we can tell from status response, "sample.txt" is currently not being tracked. You will need to add "sample.txt" to the index first in order to track its change.</p> 
    <p>In order to do that, you will use the "add" command followed by the &lt;file&gt; that you wish to add to the index. If you would like to add multiple files to the index, you can do so by separating them with a space.</p>

    <p class="Mg-b30">Your push to the remote repository will be rejected if your local repository is out of date, possibly because there are some updates that are on the remote repository added by others that you do not have locally yet.</p>

    <p class="Mg-b30">If that is the case, do a "merge" to grab the latest change from the remote repository before you are allowed to push. Git enforces this to ensure that changes made by other members get retained in the history (Commit C in the figure above).</p> 
    <div class="Important Mg-b60"> 
     <p>During "merge", Git will attempt to automatically apply those history changes and merge them with the current branch. However, if there is a conflict in changes, Git will throw an error prompting you to resolve the conflict manually. We will cover the ways to resolve such conflicts in the next page.</p>

    <p>As described in the previous page, Git will attempt to automatically apply the merging changes into an existing change history when executing "merge".</p> 
    <p>There are times that "merge" could fail and that can happen when there is a conflict. If two or more members make changes on the same part of a file in the two different branches (remote and local branch in this case) that are being merged, Git will not be able to automatically merge them and you will get a merge conflict.</p> 
    <p>When this happens, Git will add some standard conflict-resolution markers to the conflicting file. The markers act as an indicator to help us figure out sections in the content of the conflicting file that needs to be manually resolved.</p>
