  <p id="p1"> This demo shows how to add live mini-previews to links on hover. Check out these links to <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/">Codrops</a> and <a href="https://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>. Hover over them to see a small preview of what they point to. </p>

  <p id="p2"> Those previews were fetched as soon as this page loaded. This is great for having the previews ready ahead of time, but can eat up extra bandwidth. As an alternative, check out these links to <a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAIM</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>. These previews aren't fetched until you hover over this paragraph. </p>

  <p id="p3"> Finally, check out these links to <a href="https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/">Daniel's blog</a>, <a href="http://jonibologna.com/">Joni's blog</a>, and <a href="https://codersblock.com/blog/">my blog</a>. These previews are only fetched when needed. This saves the most bandwidth, but there will be a delay before the previews can be shown. </p>
