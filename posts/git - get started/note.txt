Git empty folder

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541253/commit-empty-folder-structure-with-git

	Another way to make a directory stay empty (in the repository) is to create a .gitignore file inside that directory that contains four lines:

	# Ignore everything in this directory
	*
	# Except this file
	!.gitignore

	Then you don't have to get the order right the way that you have to do in m104's solution.
