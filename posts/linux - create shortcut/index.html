   <p>If you have a program you use regularly on Linux desktop, you may want to create a "desktop shortcut", so you can launch the program by simply clicking on the shortcut.</p> 
   <p>A desktop shortcut is represented by a corresponding .desktop file which contains meta information of a given app. Desktop shortcut files are placed in /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications. The former directory stores shortcuts that are available fore every user, while the later directory stores shortcuts created for a particular user only.</p> 
   <p>To manually create a desktop shortcut for a particular program or command, you can create a .desktop file using any text editor, and place it in either /user/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications.</p> 
   <p>A typical .desktop file looks like the following:</p> 
   <pre>[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0                                     # version of an app.
