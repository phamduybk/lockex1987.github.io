A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/elishaterada/pen/tGokD.

 This pen contains variables of all brand icon colors for Font Awesome 4.4 which you can use for LESS / SASS environment. Simply load the variables in your style and all the brand icons will have colors added automatically.

I borrowed many color references from BrandColors.net, and others from official website pallette or using Kuler on raster logo. When there are multiple colors in a logo, I picked a color used most often on the website.
