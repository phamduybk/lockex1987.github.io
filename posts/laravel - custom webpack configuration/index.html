   <h3>Custom Webpack Configuration</h3> 
   <p>Behind the scenes, Laravel Mix references a pre-configured <code>webpack.config.js</code> file to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Occasionally, you may need to manually modify this file. You might have a special loader or plug-in that needs to be referenced, or maybe you prefer to use Stylus instead of Sass. In such instances, you have two choices:</p> 
   <h4>Merging Custom Configuration</h4> 
   <p>Mix provides a useful <code>webpackConfig</code> method that allows you to merge any short Webpack configuration overrides. This is a particularly appealing choice, as it doesn't require you to copy and maintain your own copy of the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. The <code>webpackConfig</code> method accepts an object, which should contain any <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/">Webpack-specific configuration</a> that you wish to apply.</p> 
   <pre><code>mix.webpackConfig({
    resolve: {
        modules: [
            path.resolve(__dirname, 'vendor/laravel/spark/resources/assets/js')
        ]
    }
});</code></pre> 
   <h4>Custom Configuration Files</h4> 
   <p>If you would like to completely customize your Webpack configuration, copy the <code>node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js</code> file to your project's root directory. Next, point all of the <code>--config</code> references in your <code>package.json</code> file to the newly copied configuration file. If you choose to take this approach to customization, any future upstream updates to Mix's <code>webpack.config.js</code> must be manually merged into your customized file.</p>
