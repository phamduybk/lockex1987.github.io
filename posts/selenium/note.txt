	Why we need to use a Web Driver?
		Because using a HTML parser library like Jsoup we cannot load content that are dynamical changed such as Javascript contents.
		Sometimes we need to maintain a session in order to crawl for long period of time.
		There are web sites that need a user account to access. In that case, we can automate login through the web driver and access the web page.
