   <p>How to change the maximum upload file size for PHP scripts</p> 
   <p>This article describes how to change the maximum upload file size for PHP scripts by using the upload_max_filesize and post_max_size directives in a php.ini file.</p> 
   <p>CHANGING THE MAXIMUM UPLOAD FILE SIZE</p> 
   <p>By default, the maximum upload file size for PHP scripts is set to 128 megabytes. However, you may want to change these limits. For example, you can set a lower limit to prevent users from uploading large files to your site. To do this, change the upload_max_filesize and post_max_size directives in your php.ini file.</p> 
   <p>To ensure that file uploads work correctly, the post_max_size directive should be a little larger than the upload_max_filesize. For example, the following settings demonstrate how to set a file upload limit to 20 megabytes:</p> 
   <pre>upload_max_filesize = 20M
post_max_size = 21M</pre> 
   <p>To verify the current value of the upload_max_filesize directive and other directives, you can use the phpinfo() function.</p> 
   <pre>; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
; http://php.net/upload-max-filesize
upload_max_filesize = 1000M

; Maximum number of files that can be uploaded via a single request
max_file_uploads = 20

; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.
; Its value may be 0 to disable the limit. It is ignored if POST data reading
; is disabled through enable_post_data_reading.
; http://php.net/post-max-size
post_max_size = 1000M</pre>
