   <p>I was taken by surprise when I found out that I could not play MIDI audio in my Ubuntu box. Apparently it has to do with your sound card. But still..!</p> 
   <p>One of the simplest methods to play a midi file in Ubuntu is to install timidity. Yeah, lovely name that.</p> 
   <p>sudo apt-get install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra freepats</p> 
   <p>You can play a midi file directly from the command timidity followed by the file name. For example:</p> 
   <p>timidity awesometune.mid</p> 
   <p>Or, if you want a GUI, you can simply type:</p> 
   <p>timidity -ig</p> 
   <p>and an old-fashioned window will pop up.</p> 
   <p>Happy listening!</p>
