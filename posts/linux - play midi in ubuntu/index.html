    <title>Playing MIDI files in Ubuntu</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I was taken by surprise when I found out that I could not play MIDI audio
      in my Ubuntu box. Apparently it has to do with your sound card. But
      still..!</p>
    <p>One of the simplest methods to play a midi file in Ubuntu is to install
      timidity. Yeah, lovely name that.</p>
    <p>sudo apt-get install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra freepats</p>
    <p>You can play a midi file directly from the command timidity followed by
      the file name. For example:</p>
    <p>timidity awesometune.mid</p>
    <p>Or, if you want a GUI, you can simply type:</p>
    <p>timidity -ig</p>
    <p>and an old-fashioned window will pop up.</p>
    <p>Happy listening!</p>
