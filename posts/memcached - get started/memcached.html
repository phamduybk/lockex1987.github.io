    <p>Memcached</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Memcached works on most Linux and BSD like systems. There is no official
      support for Windows builds.</p>
    <h3>From package</h3>
    <p>Generally, you should install memcached from a package provided by your
      operating system. The OS will solve dependencies for you and take care of
      security updates.</p>
    <p>It's very simple. For Debian or Ubuntu:</p>
    <p>apt-get install memcached</p>
    <p>For Redhat/Fedora:</p>
    <p>yum install memcached</p>
    <p><strong>Problems with packages</strong></p>
    <p>Most users run an older OS. Please keep in mind that old OSs don't have
      newer versions of memcached. Even new version of some OSs don't have the
      latest version available.</p>
    <p>You can upgrade your package or build from source.</p>
    <h3>From source</h3>
    <p>Memcached depends on libevent.</p>
    <p>Installing from source:</p>
    <p>wget https://memcached.org/latest<br>
      [you might need to rename the file]<br>
      tar -zxf memcached-1.x.x.tar.gz<br>
      cd memcached-1.x.x<br>
      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/memcached<br>
      make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; sudo make install</p>
    <p>Windows</p>
    <p>Memcached is originally a linux application, but since it is open-source,
      it has been compiled for windows. There are two major sources for the
      pre-built windows binary: Jellycan and Northscale, and both versions can
      be used. The following are the download links for the memcached windows
      binaries:</p>
