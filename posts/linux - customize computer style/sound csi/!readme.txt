CSI - Computer Sounds Integration

Have you ever noticed all the bleeps and blips that computers make in the movies? Seems like any time
text is presented on a screen that it must be accompanied by teletype-style beeping. Computers in
the movies are always zooming into things (rarely losing any definition in the process) and when they 
do there's always that "zoom-in" sound. So whether it's CSI, Bones, Law and Order, 24, or any movie 
with the token computer-hacker-guy, don't let your computer feel left out.

It's a rainy day. I thought it would be fun to create a sound theme that made my machine sound like
something from the set of CSI. With some inspiration from Nullsoft Beep and http://www.dewa.com/sound 
(admittedly, some of the sounds are modified versions of sounds available on dewa.com) I cranked
up my audio editor and began synthesizing some sounds.

The result was a sound theme for Windows XP/Vista (and maybe 7) that provides Hollywood-style sound 
effects for your computer. 


Installation
1. Download the CSISounds.zip file
2. Extract the CSI folder as a subfolder in your C:\Windows\Media folder.
3. Double click the "CSI Sound Scheme.reg" registry file and import the CSI registry settings
4. Open Control Panel and go to the Sound applet
5. Choose CSI as your sound scheme
6. Enjoy


If your Windows folder is not C:\Windows, open the reg file in a text editor and do a global replace
of "C:\\Windows" with the appropriate path to your Windows folder. Be sure to include the double
backslashes.
