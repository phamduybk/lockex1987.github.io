   <p>If you've not used pub/sub before, the gist is that you publish to a topic and anyone can subscribe, much like the way a radio works: a radio station broadcasts (publishes) and anyone can listen (subscribes). This is excellent for highly modular web applications; it's a license to globally communicate without attaching to any specific object.</p> 
   <p>I use pub/sub religiously on this website and this object has done me a world of good. I have one topic that fires upon each AJAX page load, and several subscriptions fire during that event (ad re-rendering, comment re-rendering, social button population, etc.). Evaluate your application and see where you might be able to use pub/sub!</p> 
   <p>Pub/Sub pattern giúp chúng ta decouple trang web to thành các component con nhưng vẫn có thể liên lạc giữa các component con.</p>
