      <h2>Convert WebP in Linux</h2>
      <p> WebP is a modern image format created by Google. It was made specially
        for the Web, providing a high compression ratio without affecting the
        image quality. On Windows, any image viewer like IrfanView can open WebP
        images and save them as JPG/PNG. On Linux however, it might be hard to
        edit or convert a WebP image, because traditional image editing tools
        like GIMP do not support WebP yet. Here is how to convert a WebP image
        to the PNG format and vice versa.</p>
      <p> There are two methods you can use to get a PNG image from an existing
        WebP image. You can use either libwebp or ffmpeg packages which provide
        tools for our tasks.</p>
      <h3> Convert WebP to PNG</h3>
      <p> Depending on your distro, libwebp may be installed out-of-the-box, or
        not. For example, in Arch Linux package dependencies are not strict, so
        libwebp doesn't get installed when you install the GUI. You should
        install it manually by running the command as root:</p>
      <pre>pacman -S libwebp</pre>
      <p> On a Debian-based distro like Linux Mint, issue the command:</p>
      <pre>apt install webp</pre>
      <p> The package provides the following tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> cwebp - a WebP encoder tool.</li>
        <li> dwebp - a WebP decoder tool.</li>
        <li> vwebp - a WebP viewer app.</li>
        <li> wepmux - a WebP muxing tool.</li>
        <li> gif2webp - a tool for converting GIF images to WebP.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> To convert a WebP image to PNG in Linux, do the following.</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Open your favorite terminal app.</li>
        <li> Type the following command:
          <pre>dwebp file.webp -o file.png</pre>
        </li>
        <li> The output file will be file.png in the PNG format. <img sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"
            src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Linux-webp-to-png.png">
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p> <strong>Note:</strong> Unfortunately, dwebp only converts WebP to
        PNG, but not to JPG. So, if you need to get a JPEG image from your WebP
        file, you need to convert it to PNG first, and then convert the PNG
        image to JPG using a tool like GIMP or convert it using ImageMagicK.</p>
      <h3> Convert WebP to PNG with ffmpeg</h3>
      <p> If you can't get libwebp installed, you can go with ffmpeg. Unlike
        libwebp, ffmpeg is widely used and comes preinstalled in many distros.
        Do it as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Open your favorite terminal app.</li>
        <li> Type the following command:
          <pre>ffmpeg -i file.webp file.png</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p> <img src="https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Linux-webp-to-png-ffmpeg.png">
      </p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that ffmpeg produces bigger files
        than the WebP encoder. You might need to adjust its options and optimize
        the output file.</p>
      <h3> Convert PNG files to WebP</h3>
      <p> The opposite conversion might also be useful. In a number of
        situations, WebP provides a better compression ratio than PNG. To
        convert a PNG file to WebP, execute the following command:</p>
      <pre>cwebp file.png -o file.webp</pre>
      <p> The default quality for WebP is set to 75. You can increase or reduce
        it by specifying the -q argument for the encoder, as follows. </p>
      <pre>cwebp -q 80 file.png -o file.webp</pre>
      <p> That's it.</p>
