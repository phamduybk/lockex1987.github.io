    <h1>How to Bake a Potato in the
      Microwave</h1>
    <p>Want to eat a steaming baked potato for dinner, but don't have the time
      or patience to put it in the oven for an hour? Bake it in the microwave!
      You'll have a delicious, fluffy baked potato in 15 minutes or less.</p>
    <img src="images/01.jpg"><br>
    <p><b>Choose the right type of potato.</b> Russet potatoes -
      also known as Idaho or baking potatoes - are the best potatoes for baking
      in the microwave. This is due to their high starch content, which yields
      extra fluffy baked potatoes. If you don't have Russets, the next best
      thing are yellow-fleshed potatoes - such as Yukon Gold - which are
      moderately starchy and yield a creamy, slightly dense baked potato.</p>
    <img src="images/02.jpg"><br>
    <b>Wash the potato.</b> It is important to give your potato a
    good wash before microwaving, especially if you're planning on eating the
    skin. Be sure to remove any stubborn dirt. If you have one, a bristled
    scrubbing brush is great for cleaning potatoes. After washing, pat the
    potato dry with a clean paper towel.
    <br>
    <img src="images/03.jpg"><br>
    <b>Season the potato.</b> Rub a little olive oil into the skin
    of the potato, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. This gives the potato a
    little extra flavor and will help to crisp up the skin.<br>
    <img src="images/04.jpg"><br>
    <b>Prick the potato with a fork.</b> This allows steam to escape
    and prevents the potato from exploding in the microwave. You should aim to
    prick the potato three or four times on each area: top, bottom, and two
    sides. Alternatively, you can cut a deep "X" onto the top of the potato,
    using a knife.<br>
    <img src="images/05.jpg"><br>
    <b>Place the potato on a microwavable plate.</b> If you want,
    you can wrap the potato in some wet paper towel first. This will help to
    keep the potato moist and prevent it from shrinking, but it will also result
    in softer skin.<br>
    <img src="images/06.jpg"><br>
    <b>Put the plate in the microwave and choose a cooking time.</b>
    Cooking times will vary depending on the size of the potato and the power of
    the microwave. Most medium to large potatoes will take between 8-12 minutes
    to cook at full power.
    <ul>
      <li>Try putting the potato in for 5 minutes to begin with, then take it
        out and turn it over so that both sides cook evenly. Place it back in
        the microwave for another 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft it is
        already. After that, if it still doesn't feel fully cooked, continue to
        microwave it in 1 minute bursts, checking after each minute.
      </li>
      <li>If you are cooking multiple potatoes at once, you will need to
        increase the cooking time by about two-thirds. For example, if one large
        potato takes 10 minutes to cook, two large potatoes would take between
        16-17 minutes.</li>
      <li>If you prefer crispy skinned potatoes, you can cook the potatoes in
        the microwave for 5-6 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet and bake
        in an oven preheated to 400 degrees F for 20 minutes. This method is
        great if you want oven-crisp potato skins, in less than half the normal
        cooking time!</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/07.jpg"><br>
    <b>Check if the potato is cooked.</b> You can check if a potato
    is cooked by sticking a fork in the center; if the fork goes in easily, but
    the center is still a little firm, the potato is ready. When in doubt, it is
    best to err on the side of undercooking, as an overcooked potato may burn or
    explode in the microwave.<br>
    <img src="images/08.jpg"><br>
    <b>Let the potato rest for five minutes.</b> This allows the
    core of the potato to finish cooking using the heat that is trapped in the
    inner layers. It also helps it to become fluffy on the inside without
    over-drying on the outside. Wrapping it in aluminum foil after taking it out
    of the microwave will speed up this process. Just be careful when touching
    the potato - it will be extremely hot!
    <ul>
      <li>If you are saving a potato for someone who's running late, wrapping
        the potato in aluminum foil will keep it warm for a remarkably long
        time. Just be sure to do this as soon as it comes out of the microwave,
        to conserve as much heat as possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/09.jpg"><br>
    <b>Serve the potato.</b> Cut the potato open and garnish it with
    your favorite toppings. Keep it simple with butter, salt and a little grated
    cheese, or jazz it up with some sour cream, green onions or chives and some
    crispy bacon. For a more complete meal, top the potato with a generous
    helping of chili con carne or some fluffy scrambled eggs.<br>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some microwaves have a "baked potato" button; use that when in doubt.</li>
      <li>If you are in a rush, you can cut open the potato immediately after
        the microwave stops, add your toppings (or not), and then do the final
        cooking in the microwave by microwaving another 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
      <li>Using a rotating carousel for microwaving is the best way to get the
        potato evenly cooked all around. If you don't have a rotating carousel,
        pause your microwave twice during the microwaving time, and manually
        turn the potato a half turn each time. To decide when to turn the
        potato, divide the cooking time into 3 fairly equal units.</li>
      <li>Lengthen the time when using microwaves with less power. An 800 Watt
        microwave requires 1.5 times the microwaving time.</li>
      <li>Try using parchment paper to wrap the potato, which can be saved and
        re-used.</li>
      <li>You can "boil" potatoes for mashing more or less the same way. Use
        thin-skinned potatoes and be extra careful not to dry them out. Plastic
        wrap or simply cooking several in a plastic bag helps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The plate will be rather hot from the microwave, so use a towel or
        oven mitt to take it out.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Do not wrap the potato in metal foil while it is inside the microwave</b>;
        this could cause sparking that damages the interior surface of your
        microwave.</li>
    </ul>
