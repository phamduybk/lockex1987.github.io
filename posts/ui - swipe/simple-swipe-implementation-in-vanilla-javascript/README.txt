A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/AliceFernandes/pen/amgrKx.

 Hi there :) I've coded this demo for an app i'm currently building, and i thought that this might be useful to other coders out there! Basically, this pen is about making swipe events available to mobile devices without using any external libraries. It uses the touchEvent to detect the finger positioning, and then calculates the move distance. If negative, triggers the right site, otherwise it triggers the left side Currently, this only works for the X-axis, but if you are feeling confident, fork this pen and finish it.
