    <h1>Page <wbr>Visibility API</h1>
    <p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong>Page Visibility API</strong> lets
        you know when a webpage is visible or in focus.</span> With tabbed
      browsing, there is a reasonable chance that any given webpage is in the
      background and thus not visible to the user. When the user minimizes the
      webpage or moves to another tab, the API sends a <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/visibilitychange"
          title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/visibilitychange">visibilitychange</a></code>
      event regarding the visibility of the page. You can detect the event and
      perform some actions or behave differently. For example, if your web app
      is playing a video, it would pause the moment the user looks at another
      browser, and plays again when the user returns to the tab. The user does
      not lose their place in the video and can continue watching.</p>
    <p>Visibility states of an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"
        title="The HTML Inline Frame Element (&lt;iframe&gt;) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a head and a body or a head and a frameset, but not both a body and a frameset. However, an &lt;iframe&gt; can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded content is called the parent browsing context. The top-level browsing context (which has no parent) is typically the browser window."><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>
      are the same as the parent document. Hiding the iframe with CSS properties
      does not trigger visibility events nor change the state of the content
      document.</p>
    <h3 id="Benefits">Benefits</h3>
    <p>The API is particularly useful for saving resources by giving developers
      the opportunity to not perform unnecessary tasks when the webpage is not
      visible.</p>
    <h3 id="Use_cases">Use cases</h3>
    <p>A few examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A site has an image carousel that shouldn't advance to the next slide
        unless the user is viewing the page.</li>
      <li>An application showing a dashboard of information doesn't want to poll
        the server for updates when the page isn't visible.</li>
      <li>A page wants to detect when it is being prerendered so it can keep
        accurate count of page views.</li>
      <li>A site wants to switch off sounds when a device is in standby mode
        (user pushes power button to turn screen off)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Developers have historically used imperfect proxies to detect this. For
      example, registering an onblur/onfocus handler on the window helps you
      know when your page is not the active page, but it does not tell you that
      your page is hidden to the user. The Page Visibility API addresses this.
      (When compared with registering onblur/onfocus handlers on the window, a
      key difference is that a page does <em>not</em> become hidden when
      another window is made active and the browser window loses focus. A page
      only becomes hidden when the user switches to a different tab or minimizes
      the browser window.)</p>
    <h2 id="Properties_overview">Properties overview</h2>
    <h3 id="document.hidden_Read_only"><code>document.hidden</code> <span class="inlineIndicator readOnly readOnlyInline"
        title="This value may not be changed.">Read only </span></h3>
    <p>Returns&nbsp;<code>true</code> if the page is in a state considered to be
      hidden to the user, and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>
    <h3 id="document.visibilityState_Read_only"><code>document.visibilityState</code>
      <span class="inlineIndicator readOnly readOnlyInline" title="This value may not be changed.">Read
        only </span></h3>
    <p>Is a <code>string</code> denoting the visibility state of the document.
      Possible values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>visible</code> : the page content may be at least partially
        visible. In practice this means that the page is the foreground tab of a
        non-minimized window.</li>
      <li><code>hidden</code> : the page content is not visible to the user. In
        practice this means that the document is either a background tab or part
        of a minimized window, or the OS screen lock is active.</li>
      <li><code>prerender</code> : the page content is being prerendered and is
        not visible to the user (considered hidden for purposes of <code>document.hidden</code>).
        The document may start in this state, but will never transition to it
        from another value. Note: browser support is optional.</li>
      <li><code>unloaded</code> : the page is being unloaded from memory. Note:
        browser support is optional.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"> The Page Visibility specification enables
      developers to determine the current visibility<br>
      of a document and be notified of visibility changes. It consists of two
      properties<br>
      and an event:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
      <li><b>document.hidden</b>: A boolean that describes whether the page is
        visible or not.</li>
      <li><b>document.visibilityState</b>: An attribute that returns the
        detailed page visibility<br>
        state, e.g., PAGE_VISIBLE, PAGE_PREVIEW, etc.</li>
      <li><b>visibilitychange</b>: An event that gets fired any time the
        visibility state of the<br>
        page changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With this interface, Web applications may choose to alter behavior based
      on whether<br>
      they are visible to the user or not. For example, the following JavaScript
      shows<br>
      a theoretical Web based email client checking for new emails every second
      without<br>
      knowledge of the Page Visibility:</p>
