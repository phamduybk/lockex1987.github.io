Oh, you're not

Oh, come on, Ken.

00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:36,263
You're forgetting that
I'm one half of the world's
greatest mystery writing team.

You, uh, don't have gloves on,
your finger's not on the trigger,

I'm a lousy practical joker.

What are you doing here
with that thing, anyway?

11
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,980
I was on my way down
to the cabin. I thought maybe
I could use it for protection.

12
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,543
Also came by to apologize.

- For blowing my cork the other day.
I got out of line.

You know, that happens.

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,824
Nah. Shouldrt happen.
Not between you and me.

16
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,925
So, believe it or not, sir,

Well, it's not really
a divorce.

Oh, sure it is.
Come on. Let's be honest.

Come on, Ken.

36
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:19,330
You're making me feel guilty.
All I want to do is write on my own.

I am being selfish.

I appreciate it.

After all, friendship is more important
than partnership. Right?

Here's to our friendship.

And now, sir,

45
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,262
I'm gonna kidnap you.

46
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,534
What?
The aforementioned cabin...

47
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,599
which has been finished
for over six months now...

48
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,735
You haven't seen it.
You're gonna be
my first male guest.

49

Oh, I can't, Ken. Not now.
Well, why can't you?

50
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,184

in San Diego.
Oh, it's a couple of hours' drive.

51

I'll have you home
before midnight.

I'd take her to dinner
and a show.

you say, ' Honey, I'm gonna be working
late at the office tonight." Come on.

54

we uncork another bottle,

Oh, no, I'm not.

Well, then, prove it.
Come on. If you want
some justification,

you're doing it
as a favor for me.

At least give me a chance
to bury the hatchet
with some style, huh?

60

then turn down his invitation
all in one week, now do you?

that broad some flowers.

64

I'd like to take from the office.

65

You want to take
a look at it?

66
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,159
I don't get it.
It's a list of names.
Oh, I'm losing my mind.

67

Ah, it's not far.
About an hour.

Exactly.
That's why she'll believe you.

151
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,313
Yeah, well, l...
I just hate lying
to her. You know.

152
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,550
You're not lying to her.
You're saving her
a little anguish.

153
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:36,082
Now, will you pick up the phone
and call her so we can
start enjoying ourselves?

154
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,152
Okay.

155
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:46,504
- Oh, Operator, I'd like to
make a collect...
- Hold it.

156
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,967
It's a cinch you have never
cheated on Joanna before.

157
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,568
If you want your wife to believe
you're calling from the office,

158
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,478
you don't have the operator
place the call... you dial it direct.

159
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,108
The area code is 213.

160
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,067
Hi, honey.

161
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,832
How are ya?

162
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,840
Well, that's what
I'm calling about.

163
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,638
<i>Um, I'm at the office, and...</i>

164
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,735
<i>I'm pretty well into</i>
<i>this last chapter.</i>

165
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,907
I'd like to work straight through.
Yeah, I know.

166
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:33,280
<i>L</i>... <i>I know.</i>

167
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:37,151
This'll be the last time.
That I can...

168
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,747
<i>[Shot Fires]</i>
Jimmy?

169
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,759
Jimmy!

170
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:56,329
Operator, get me the police.

171
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,426
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

172
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,577
Hello. Joanna?

173
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,644
What?

174
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,855
Joanna...

175
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:51,054
Will you take it easy?
Now, say it again once more.

176
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:54,588
Are you sure?

177
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,792
Did you call the police?

178
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,806
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll leave right away.

179
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:05,638
Uh, Joanna, please.

180
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,701
Take it easy.

181
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,078
And don't worry.

182
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,949
I'm sure it's nothing
but a practical joke.

183
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,312
Good-bye.

184
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,413
No, I know it's insane.

185
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:48,384
And l-l-I just... I keep
thinking of the clichés and-and...

186
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,320
Jim and Ken
wrote this scene...

187
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:53,653
in their books a hundred times.

188
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,285
Look at it this way, Mrs. Ferris.
Maybe he isn't dead.

189
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,295
Now, there's no body,
no blood...

190
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:01,355
No! He was shot!
L-I know it!

191
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,492
L-l-I heard...
I heard it on the phone.

192
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,627
Are you sure
it was a gunshot?
This place was searched.

193
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,731
- Papers on the floor.
Have you any idea why?
- <i>No, I have no idea why.</i>

194
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,572
<i>Did you notice</i>
<i>anything special missing?</i>

195
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,807
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Are you sure it was his voice?</i>

196
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,646
<i>[Joanna]</i>
<i>Yes, I know it was his voice,</i>
<i>and maybe somebody</i>...

197
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,118
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Was he under any kind</i>
<i>of extra pressure?</i>

198
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,280
<i>[Joanna]</i>
<i>No. Maybe somebody was</i>...

199
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,881
- Did he say where he was calling from?
- Yes.

200
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,984
He said he was calling
from the office. He said... He said...

201
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,961
<i>"I'm calling from the office."</i>

202
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,521
<i>I really don't care</i>
<i>if anything was missing.</i>

203
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,727
<i>I just really want to find out</i>
<i>what happened to my husband.</i>

204
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,895
We'll do our best.
<i>You sure it was his voice?</i>

205
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:42,997
<i>I know it was his voice.</i>
Are you sure it was a gunshot?

206
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,702
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>
<i>[Man] Would you like to sit down</i>
<i>and get a glass of water?</i>

207
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,836
Yes, I would like...
Really, please.

208
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,005
'Cause I really feel stupid,

209
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,606
and I just really
want to clear my head.
<i>Get the water.</i>

210
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,675
Okay.

211
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:13,203
<i>[Columbo]</i>
<i>I think that's out of order, ma'am.</i>

212
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:16,638
Uh, you see, that's the trouble
with these buildings.
The fountains never work.

213
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,734
Then you have to use
the coffee machine.

214
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,678
And then you lose your dime
and the coffee's lousy.

215
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:25,409
Who are you?
Uh, I'm just another cop.

216
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:28,452
My name's Columbo.
I'm a lieutenant.

217
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,681
Were you in there...
I got the proof right here.

218
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,790
You didn't see me in there
because I left before you got in there.

219
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:41,594
And you know why?
Because it's so smoky in there
and so noisy in there...

220
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,793
that I just had to come outside
and get a breath.

221
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,234
Oh, I think I'd better get back.
Now, look.
Wait a minute.

222
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:49,034
Let me tell you something.
You look very tired to me,

223
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:52,508
and I think you had
a terrible experience in there.

224
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:56,240
And I think
I ought to drive you home.
Let's call it a night.

225
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,908
Well, don't you think
they want to ask me questions?

226
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:02,612
Oh, I don't think they'll mind.
I think you've answered
enough questions,

227
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:05,247
and I'll call them
and I'll tell them you're with me.

228
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,188
Okay?
Well, what about Ken?

229
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,419
Why isn't Ken here?

230
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:11,428
I don't know why he isn't here.

231
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:14,932
Is that Mr. Franklin,
the other half of the writing team?

232
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,194
[Chuckles]

233
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,668
Yeah, the other half
of the team.

234
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,564
You know, that's what I like
about these buttons.

235
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:27,304
You don't have to push 'em.
They go off with the heat
of your hand.

236
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:31,281
I bet you haven't had
anything to eat.

237
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:42,350
You're a very nice man, Lieutenant,
but I'm not really hungry.

238
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:46,386
I'll tell you, Mrs. Ferris,
I'm the worst cook in the world.

239
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:49,399
But there's one thing I do terrific,
and that's an omelet.

240
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:53,096
Even my wife admits it.
Uh, I need something for the eggshells.

241
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:56,402
- Over there in that cabinet.
- Right.

242
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:58,942
I'm really not hungry.
<i>Listen.</i>

243
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,638
You take a taste.
You don't like it,

244
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,647
you throw it away.

245
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,774
I'll tell you what the secret is
to a good omelet.

246
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,342
- No eggs. Just milk.
- [Stifled Chuckle]

247
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,584
- Uh, skillet.
- Over there.

248
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,323
You're a very persuasive man,
Lieutenant.

249
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,693
Maybe I should hold up my end
and make the coffee.

250
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,377
I need cheese and onions
and, uh, butter.

251
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,313
Cheese... Uh, I need something
to grate the cheese.

252
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,577
Over there in the cupboard.

253
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,642
Right.

254
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:52,294
What did they do with him,
Lieutenant?

255
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,922
I don't know, ma'am.

256
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,299
<i>Well, there was no body in the office.</i>
<i>Couldrt that mean that he isn't dead?</i>

257
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,669
Well, that's hard to say.
Uh, it's bothering me too.

258
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,334
I tell ya, the whole thing
doesn't make sense
unless it's a kidnapping.

259
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,868
Well, you don't shoot
a victim first, do you?

260
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,575
Why'd you laugh before?
When?

261
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:15,312
When I asked you if Mr. Franklin was
the other half of the writing team.

262
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:18,048
Did I laugh?
Yep.

263
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,113
Maybe it was the way you put it.

264
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,386
'Writing team."

265
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,519
Maybe I shouldn't say it,

266
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,430
but Ken hasn't written a word
of a Mrs. Melville novel in years.

267
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
Mrs. Melville?
Who's Mrs. Melville?

268
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,529
The character
thatJim and Ken created.

269
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,438
The one who solves
all the crimes brilliantly.

270
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,602
Well, uh, why did your husband
put up with it?

271
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:42,703
What I mean is, uh,
him doing all the work.

272
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,442
Well, there were compensations.

273
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,078
Ken did the publicity,
went on all the talk shows,

274
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:53,783
and he did interviews
and cultivated the film people.

275
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,349
He contributed.

276
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:58,361
He just didn't do
any of the writing.

277
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:00,556
Boy, I'll tell ya,
I'd love to be a writer.

278
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,566
That's a terrific talent.

279
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,795
Where did he get
all the ideas?

280
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:06,996
Oh, from almost anything.

281
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,904
People. Magazines.

282
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:12,602
Conversations.

283
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:16,636
I'm constantly finding
scraps of paper
and old matchbook covers...

284
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,774
just all over the house
with notes and ideas.

285
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,479
And those were mysteries, too,
werert they, huh?

286
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,784
Mm-hmm.
They're tricky.
I'll tell you that.

287
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,915
I could never
figure those things out.

288
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:29,391
Well, it got harder.

289
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,020
Maybe that's why he decided
to go out on his own.

290
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,725
Oh, really? I didn't know that.
I guess he wanted to do
some serious work.

291
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,927
No kidding?

292
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:41,597
How did Mr. Franklin take that?

293
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,665
Not very well.

294
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,302
But he'll get over it.

295
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:50,211
Gee, I'd hate to be in his shoes.
Why?

296
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:54,217
Well, you got a writing team, and they're
very famous, and now they break up,
and what happens?

297
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:57,652
One fella continues writing books,
and the other fella just stops.

298
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:00,850
Yeah. That's what
I keep telling Jim...

299
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:04,417
that sooner or later,
people are bound to find out.

300
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,963
What, that your husband
did all the writing?
Mmm.

301
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,829
Yeah.

302
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,529
Kind of tough
on Mr. Franklirs ego.

Oh, Ken!
Jo.

305
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:47,335
I know, I know.
Just take it easy.

306
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,839
I drove up here

Is there anything new?
No, not yet.

308
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,045
Jo, it's incredible.

309
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,139
I just saw him
this morning at the office.

310
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,343
Oh, I'm sorry, Ken.
Uh,

311
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:03,319
Lieutenant Columbo,
Mr. Franklin.

312
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,755
How you doir?
No, the question is,
how you doing, Lieutenant?

313
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,224
Well, I'm afraid
we just got started.

314
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,662
Has Jim been found yet?

315
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,028
Has he been found yet?
Uh...

316
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,090
Why? Did somebody tell you
he was gone?

317
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:20,569
Lieutenant, I just spent several hours
driving up here from San Diego.

318
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,038
You must know that this story
is on every news station.

319
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:26,099
Oh, right. Yeah.
Gee, I should have thought of that.

320
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:29,408
Well, has he been found?
Gee, I'm afraid not.

321
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,074
No. Were you visiting friends
in San Diego?

322
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,950
He has a place there... a cabin.
Oh, away for the weekend.
Gee, that's nice.

323
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,250
Mmm. Could we get back
to my question?

324
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:40,256
Have you come up with
any leads, any clues?

325
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:43,760
Uh, it's a little early for that.
<i>Early?</i>

326
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:47,264
Seems to me your men are
standing around just marking time.

327
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:49,265
Could I have a drink, love?

328
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,893
I could use one myself.
Thanks.

329
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,206
I'll tell you something,
Lieutenant.

330
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,710
<i>See, if Mrs. Melville</i>
<i>were on this case,</i>

331
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:02,211
oh, she'd be leaps and bounds
ahead of you by now.

332
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,078
Is that the lady in the books?
<i>That's right.</i>

333
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:10,651
You see, she would have
figured out that this is not
just someone missing.

334
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,953
This is a professional killing.

335
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,664
Aha. Here it is.

336
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:29,797
Take a look at that.
Uh, put it on the desk.

337
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:32,604
Just drop it. 'Cause of
the fingerprints, you know.

338
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,475
Jim's fingerprints
are all over that.
So are mine.

339
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:42,312
What is it?
What's it look like?
It's a list of names.

340
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:47,050
Look at that. Mustel,
Delgado, Hathaway, Westlake...

341
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,288
Sound familiar?
Uh, yeah, kinda.

342
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:54,855
Well, they should. That's a list
of some of the top men
in organized crime on the West Coast...

343
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:58,231
L.A., Vegas, Frisco...
I don't understand.

344
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:00,600
Well, it's painfully obvious.

345
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,969
One of these men
had Jim killed.

346
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,770
Really? Why?

347
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:09,404
Tell me something.
How long have you been
a lieutenant, Lieutenant?

348
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,074
Mrs. Melville would have
put that together like that.
[Snaps Fingers]

349
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,779
Look, l... I'm willing to take
all the help I can get.

350
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:18,788
All right. Let me see
if I can explain it to you.

351
00:24:18,856 --> 00:24:21,882
See, my partner and I
decided to split,
go our separate ways.

352
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,893
I'm sureJoanna must have
mentioned that to you.

353
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,054
Yeah, she said
something about that.

354
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,794
Did she also mention the fact
thatJim wanted to do
some serious writing?

355
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:33,200
Hey.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

356
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,831
Wait a minute. Yeah!
Dawning on you now?
I knew you'd get it.

357
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,341
But that's only
the tip of the iceberg.

358
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:41,845
You see, Jim was researching
a complete and factual exposé...

359
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,881
of all West Coast organized crime.

360
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,974
I mean, he was going around asking
some pretty embarrassing questions.

361
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,519
<i>Probing.</i>
<i>Compiling dossiers.</i>

362
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,521
<i>That's why</i>
<i>they searched this office.</i>

363
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:54,353
Apparently, they got everything
but that list.

364
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,485
And you think one of these fellas
put out a contract on him.

365
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,963
Of course. Word must have gotten around
thatJim was compiling all this information.

366
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,592
They knew they couldn't buy him off,
so what do they do?

367
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,728
<i>They chose the usual</i>
<i>alternative.</i>

368
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:11,173
Professional killing, huh?
But if that's true,
why did they get rid of the body?

369
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,606
Well, who knows?
But remember one thing...
Without a corpus delicti,

370
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,911
you can't prove a murder
was committed in the first place.

371
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,417
But why would
a professional killer care?

372
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:24,181
I mean, he's already on a plane
back from where he came.

373
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:28,715
Lieutenant, I can't answer
all your questions. I've given you
a list of the most likely suspects.

374
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,523
A clear motive.
Isn't that enough to start with?

375
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:36,056
Oh, that's plenty.
And believe me, I'm very grateful
for all the help you've given me.

376
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,564
Gee, that's funny.
What?

377
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,974
Well, this thing is folded lengthwise,
like someone was carrying it
in their pocket.

378
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,035
So?

379
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,115
Well, if he typed that
on that typewriter...

380
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,310
and I'll run a check on that...

381
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,910
why would he fold it up
before he put it in that drawer?

382
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:00,950
[Chuckling]
I'm beginning to like you.

383
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:05,223
Why is that?
Because you're finally beginning
to think like Mrs. Melville.

384
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,557
Unfortunately, Jim used to
fold up a piece of paper,

385
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,727
and he'd use it
as a bookmark, you know.
Ah.

386
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:14,066
Now, however interesting
your observation is,

387
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:16,766
it only leads us far astray.

388
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:21,744
However,
since you are beginning to learn
how to emulate our dear lady,

389
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:24,280
I'm gonna give you something
that you richly deserve...

390
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:26,475
a chance to read
some of our books.

391
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,215
Well, that's very nice of you.
Didrt expect gifts tonight, huh?

392
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,121
Thank you. Maybe I can
pick up a few pointers.

393
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,124
Oh, I'm sure you can.

394
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,490
Uh, could you handle
some more?
Oh, all right.

395
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:40,962
Here you go.
Oh, and an extra.
Oh, that's very nice.

396
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,694
That ought to keep you busy
for a while, huh?
Yeah, it sure will.

397
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,760
Well, anything else, Lieutenant?
Uh, no, I don't think so.

398
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:49,601
I think I'd better let you
get some sleep.
Oh, that's very nice of you.

399
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,541
I just only hope
I was of some help.
Oh, you certainly were.

400
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,443
Well, good night, Lieutenant.
Good night, sir.
Good night.

401
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,448
Oh, Mr. Franklin. Uh...

402
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,144
Actually, uh, there is one thing,

403
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,448
not that it makes
that much difference.

404
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,455
What is it?

405
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,923
When Mrs. Ferris called you
and told you her husband got shot,

406
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:10,187
you jumped in a car and drove
right back to L.A.

407
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,957
Is that right?
That's right.

408
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,624
You know, me,
I'd have taken a plane.

409
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,295
I mean, it's a big airport,
and they run every half hour.
It'd been a lot faster.

410
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:25,570
Well, l... That's true,
but in a situation like that,
who thinks clearly?

411
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:30,410
And look at it this way.
You add up all the time it takes
to drive to and from an airport,

412
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,415
how much time
do you really save?

413
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:37,687
Hmm.

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,464
What? No comment.

446
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,867
Aw, you've gotta be kidding.
You want an interview now?

447
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:46,975
A gentleman of the press.
<i>Afraid you're gonna get</i>
<i>a lot of that.</i>

448
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,340
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I'm forgetting my manners.
Would you like a drink?

449
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,510
<i>Yeah. Mmm.</i>
<i>Maybe a drop ofbourbon.</i>

450
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,577
Bourbon.

451
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,186
Boy, this is quite a place.

452
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,386
This a copy?

453
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,452
<i>Hardly.</i>
<i>It's an original.</i>

454
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,861
Gee, I thought they only
hung this stuff on museums.

455
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,868
<i>You own this?</i>

456
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,302
Mrs. Melville has been very kind.

457
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,473
Boy. Quite a place.

458
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:23,104
Gee whiz. And you got
that other place in San Diego.

459
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,547
Gee, the upkeep alone must be...

460
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,847
I manage to scrape by.
Your drink.

461
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,013
Thank you. You know,
there's one thing about writers
that I don't understand.

462
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,023
Maybe you can help me
clear it up.

463
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,218
If a fella's partner dies,

464
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:40,662
uh, does he own the other
fella's half of the books,
half of the, uh, um...

465
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,665
Royalties?
Yeah.

466
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:45,964
No. They go
into the deceased's estate.

467
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,403
Mmm. That leaves you
out in the cold, doesn't it?

468
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:52,135
Unless, of course,
you insured each other.

469
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:55,440
Lieutenant, aren't we going
a bit far astray?

470
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:57,776
You're right. We shouldn't
be talking about this now.

471
00:31:57,848 --> 00:31:59,782
It's not the time.

472
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,318
Uh... Uh...

473
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:05,514
So, Mr. Franklin, tell me, uh,

474
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:10,083
why do you think that they left
your partner's body out there
on the lawn like that?

475
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,890
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't figured that out?

476
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,295
Lieutenant,
you disappoint me.

477
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:19,027
It was left as a warning.
A warning?

478
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,469
Of course.

479
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:25,872
It also proves my theory about
it being a professional killing.

480
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:30,346
See, the moment they dropped
Jim's body in the middle
of that lawn...

481
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:33,042
<i>Please, sit down.</i>

482
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,176
<i>You know</i>
<i>what they were saying?</i>

483
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:37,720
That this could happen to you...

484
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,983
unless you stop
in your partner's research.

485
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,049
- They're trying to scare you.
- Exactly.

486
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,118
Right.

487
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:48,289
So what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna continue
writing the book anyway?

488
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:53,359
No, that's the irony of it.
You see, that was Jim's
pet project, not mine.

489
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:56,031
[Chuckles]
I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

490
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:59,974
Say, I guess they didn't have
any way of knowing
you two were gonna split up.

491
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:04,674
Nah. Even if they did,
it wouldn't have doneJim any good.

492
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:08,149
<i>I must say, Lieutenant,</i>
<i>you're up against a dead end.</i>

493
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:10,812
Look at this.
You got a body,

494
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,015
you got a motive,

495
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,581
but you're never
gonna find that killer.

496
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,127
It's not gonna be easy.

497
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:21,164
I'll lay you 5 to <i>1</i>
it was someone
in Las Vegas or Miami.

498
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:25,998
Picked up a phone and...
pfft! ...put out a contract.
Right. Right.

499
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,166
How you're gonna make a case,
much less solve one,
is beyond me.

500
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,700
I know. I guess the only thing
I can do is... just check out
every name on that list.

501
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:38,976
Sure. You know what's gonna
happen? Every one of those guys
is gonna deny thatJim even existed.

502
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,983
Right.

503
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:43,918
I must say
I don't envy you.
I don't envy myself.

504
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,115
Now, look. I got a lot
of phone calls to make.
I'd better get on it, huh?

505
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:51,287
All the luck.
Thanks. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Franklin.

506
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,762
And listen. I'm very sorry
about what happened tonight.

507
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,822
Thank you.
Right.

508
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,071
You, uh...

509
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:05,802
<i>You will keep me posted,</i>
<i>Lieutenant?</i>
Oh, yes, I will. Yeah.

510
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,174
You know, there's only one thing
that I'm not clear about.

511
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,304
But that can wait.
You want to go to bed.

512
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:15,611
Lieutenant, I'm not gonna
get any sleep anyway.
What is it?

513
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,348
Would you go over for me
once again... I know you did it...

514
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:21,391
exactly what happened
when you came home tonight?

515
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,723
Sure. L...
I've already told you, but...

516
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:28,162
[Sighs]
The moment I saw Jim's body
in the middle of the lawn,

517
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,894
I came running in here
and I picked up the phone
and I called you.

518
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,165
I mean, it's a purely
reflexive action.

519
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,297
Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.

520
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:39,740
Uh-huh. That's fine.
Now, wait a minute.
You look like you're troubled.

521
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,244
Is there some reason
for your question?

522
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:45,145
Uh, it's your mail.

523
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:48,013
My mail?
Isn't it funny
how people are different?

524
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:52,283
Now, me, if I found my partner dead,
I'd never think of opening my letters.

525
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,023
But l-l... I just did it
to distract myself.

526
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:01,428
I mean, you got to remember
one thing, that's a great shock.

527
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:04,661
Yeah.
Oh, that's understandable.

528
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:08,171
And bills are distracting.
Listen, if anything comes up,

529
00:35:08,238 --> 00:35:10,263
I'll call you right away.

530
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,002
Good night.
Good night.

531
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,216
I'm gonna have a hot dog.
I guess I will too.

532
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,367
No, no, Mr. Tucker.
You put that away.

533
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,426
This one's on me.

534
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:44,632
May I have a receipt, please?

535
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,874
All right, Lieutenant.
You're bribing me
with a handsome lunch.

536
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:53,348
What can I do for you?
Uh, this is about
an insurance policy.

537
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,977
Oh, excellent.
It's about time you came to me.

538
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,453
I can give you
a package within your...
Yeah, this is, uh,

539
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,649
an insurance policy
that was already written.

540
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:06,319
Oh, this is official business.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, there are two mystery writers...

541
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:09,559
Ken Franklin and James Ferris.

542
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,295
Your company
wrote a policy on them?
Now, wait a minute, Lieutenant.

543
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:14,997
We like to cooperate
with the police, but...

544
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:18,269
if you want confidential information,
I'm afraid that you...
Oh, well, look, uh,

545
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,276
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

546
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,778
Maybe it'll be more helpful
if I got a court order?

547
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,812
[Chattering]

548
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,782
[Chattering Continues]

549
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:47,199
Oh, Ken, it was simply marvelous.
I was terrified.

550
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:51,935
Oh, really?
I had the whole thing figured out
by the end of the first act.

551
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,569
Oh, you did?
I was completely fooled.

552
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,672
You must have a devious mind.
No, dear,
it's because you're young.

553
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,309
Always remember
one thing, my love.

554
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,649
The moment
a man mentions a long-lost twin,

555
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,781
you can inevitably know that it's
going to be some impersonation.

556
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,588
It's an old plot trick.

557
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:14,597
Mr. Franklin! Yoo-hoo!

558
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:19,830
- Over here!
- Who's that?

559
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,701
Someone
that should be somewhere else.

560
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,139
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>No, we go this way.</i>
Excuse me a moment.

561
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:31,672
Miss La Sanka,
what a pleasant surprise.
Hi. [Giggling]

562
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:35,878
What brings you to the big city?
Oh, I came in to do
a little shopping.

563
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,012
You... You like my dress?
Oh, it's lovely.

564
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:40,955
See a play.
[Laughs]

565
00:37:41,024 --> 00:37:43,390
She's a beauty,
Mr. Franklin.

566
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,587
<i>Yes, she is.</i>
<i>Uh, thank you.</i>

567
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:47,857
I haven't seen her before
have I?

568
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,058
No, I don't believe you have.

569
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:53,034
Well, it's...
it's lovely to see you.
I, uh,

570
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,571
hope you won't think
I'm being forward,
[Chuckles]

571
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,575
But is there any chance of, uh,
our having a drink together?

572
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:01,577
Oh, I'd... I'd love to, really.
But, uh...

573
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:04,011
See, the young lady and I
are going to have a late supper.

574
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,346
I think you might want to cancel it.

575
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,419
- Just why would I want to do that?
- Because...

576
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,187
we really should have a discussion.
[Chuckles]

577
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,790
Perhaps some other time.
All right. L...

578
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:25,892
I suppose I'll have to find
someone else to tell my story to.
[Chuckles]

579
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,563
It's a mystery story.

580
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,834
Very interesting.
Really.

581
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:35,708
It's all about this witness.
[Chuckles]

582
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:40,215
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

583
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:43,650
Anything you say, Mr. Franklin.

592
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,882
That's quite a stare.
I'm sorry.
L-I can't help it.

593
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,111
You know,
I've never seen you outside
that store before.

594
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:18,814
You're very lovely.

595
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,519
May I call you Lili?
Yes, please do.
[Giggles]

596
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,860
How did you enjoy
the play tonight?
Oh, I thought
it was predictable. You?

597
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:35,530
Oh, I like your books
much more.
That's very flattering.

598
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,039
But you said something before
about, uh,

599
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,599
about your story
or something about a...
a witness.

600
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:44,670
Oh, yes. Well, actually,

601
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:48,309
it's a, uh,
true-to-life story.

602
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:50,683
Oh, the best kind.
[Giggles]

603
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:54,121
It concerns your partner.
Jim?

604
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,716
Uh-huh.
What about him?

605
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:00,251
Well, I read in the papers
about his death,

606
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,356
and I felt just terrible.
Thank you.

607
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:08,769
I felt just terrible, because they said
he was killed in his office.

608
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,603
So they did.
Well,

609
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,235
in my story, you see,

610
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,871
he couldn't have actually
been killed in an office,

611
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,348
because he was, uh,

612
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,408
somewhere else.

613
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,854
Just for a moment,
let's forget about your story,

614
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:28,254
and let's, uh...
let's talk about real life.

615
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:33,854
[Chuckles]
It is simpler, isn't it?
Much.

616
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,296
I'll tell you honestly, Ken.

617
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:40,860
I was very confused
when I saw the papers,
because,

618
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:45,374
when you were in my store
making a phone call the other day,
Uh-huh.

619
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:48,775
I wandered over
to the side window to see...

620
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:51,712
if you had brought a lady with you.
[Giggles]

621
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,548
You didn't believe me when I said
that I was alone.
Oh, I believed you.
It's just that...

622
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:00,114
I'm very interested in you, Ken.

623
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,391
[Giggles]
Well, anyway,

624
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:08,431
you can imagine my surprise
when I saw your partner.

625
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:11,023
There he was, big as life,

626
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,468
sitting there
in the front seat of your car.

627
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:18,474
And that disturbed you, huh?
Oh, not at that time.

628
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:21,700
Only later.

629
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:23,973
And then I debated
with myself for days...

630
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,811
whether to come
and see you or not.

631
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:32,648
Why didn't you go to the police?
Oh, Ken.

632
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:35,714
I wouldn't want
to get you into trouble.
[Giggling]

633
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:39,489
Of course not.
[Snorting Chuckle]
All right, Lili. How much?

634
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,657
[Laughs]
I hope you don't think that
that's the on...

635
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:44,859
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't think anything.

636
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:49,304
I'll tell you something.
I'm most grateful you came to me first.

637
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:55,140
Know why?
Because I think we can reach
an equitable agreement.

638
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,874
I do so admire your candor.

639
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:02,813
This isn't easy for me...
a widow running a...

640
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:06,720
small country store,
trying to make ends meet.
Oh, I can understand that.

641
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,692
And I also recognize in you
a woman of... of some breeding.

642
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,696
I mean, you're not just
a common... blackmailer.

643
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:17,562
I'm so glad you're understanding.

644
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:20,194
Very well, Lili.

645
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,704
How much for your silence?

646
00:42:27,143 --> 00:42:29,441
$15,000? L...
<i>[Plate Clattering]</i>

647
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:32,913
Oh! L-I know it's a lot,
but that's all I'll ever ask for.
Honestly.

648
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,851
- And I'm a woman of my word!
- I know you are, and I respect you for that.

649
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,854
And you know what?

650
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:43,382
In that spirit, I accept your terms.
Agreed?

651
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,759
[Relieved Chuckle]
Agreed.

652
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,664
[Chuckles]
And I know you won't take offense
when I say,

653
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,725
'It's a pleasure
doing business with you."

654
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:57,899
No, no. My pleasure.

00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:15,182
He's occupied at the moment.
Who shall I say is calling?

659
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:18,921
Uh, Lt. Columbo.
Oh. Well, won't you

After all, your magazine
was very kind to Franklin and Ferris
during our lean years.

665
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:53,025
That's, uh, the second reason
I granted the interview.
Oh? What was the first?

00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:57,624
- Why, the charm
of the interviewer, of course.

Yes, Lieutenant.
Is there something I can do for you?

Oh, yeah. If-lf you...

<i>Uh, just one last question.</i>

674
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:27,296
I think our readers will want to know
how the death of your partner will affect
the Mrs. Melville books.

675
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,856
I'm afraid when I buried Jim
I buried Mrs. Melville with him.

676
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,334
Mmm, I understand.

677
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:36,531
But everyone will miss her so.
Can't you write another one?

678
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:39,302
Oh, I could, naturally,
but what's the point?

679
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:43,039
With Jim gone, there...
[Smacks Lips]
Wouldn't be much reason.

680
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:47,777
No, I'm afraid, uh,
Mrs. Melville has solved
her last case.

681
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:52,652
Actually, I've been...
seriously debating as to whether
I would ever want to write again.

682
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:56,249
Oh, well, I hope you do.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

Now, if you don't mind, huh?
Of course.
Let's go Harvey.

00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,360
Perhaps,
under better circumstances,
I, uh...

685
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:09,804
less harassed circumstances...
I could give you a more detailed interview.

686
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,171
- Even in more depth.
- <i>Mmm, that'll be nice.</i>

687
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:18,442
Shall I call you?
Yes. Please do.
Next week, huh?

688
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,817
Good-bye.

689
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,422
Oh, sorry, Harvey.
Thanks, very much.
Thank you.

690
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,959
All right, Lieutenant.
What can I do for you?

691
00:45:40,036 --> 00:45:43,062
Well, I brought back your books.

692

<i>Well, that's fine.</i>
<i>Just put 'em over there</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,705
Yeah. Uh, sure.
I wanted to tell ya how much
I enjoyed 'em.

What a character, what a brain.

697
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,492
<i>And what logic.!</i>
<i>The way she figures it out.!</i>
Lieutenant.

698
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,462
I'd love to sit down
and discuss literature with you,
but I was on my way out.

699
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,998
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

700
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:12,694
I didn't mean to bother ya.
Uh, you goir someplace special?

701
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,068
Yes, as a matter of fact.
I'm on my way down to my cabin
for a rest.

702
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:19,370
- Would you like an itinerary?
- Hey, I'm sorry.

703
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:22,502
- I'm makir a pest of myself.
- No.

704
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,174
Yes, yes, I am.
I know, it's because I keep
askir these questions.

705
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:29,309
But I'll tell ya.
I can't help myself.

706
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:32,320
It's a habit.
I take it you're not goir alone.

707
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,887
- Whatever gave that idea?
- I noticed the two bottles of champagne.

708
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:41,594
Oh, those. Oh, I'm quite capable
of drinking those two bottles...

709
00:46:41,664 --> 00:46:43,723
and a good deal more
without any help.

710
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,133
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Lieutenant.

711
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:50,172
Yeah. Uh, listen.
Unless you just wanna take a second...

712
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,437
to know how we're progressir
on your partner's list.

713
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,140
Oh?
Anything concrete?

714
00:46:57,213 --> 00:47:00,671
No, not a thing.
Just like you predicted.

715
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,184
Everyone said
they never even heard ofJames Ferris.

716
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,687
[Smacks Lips]
That's just as I expected.

717
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:09,623
Well, it was lovely to chat with you,
Lieutenant.

718
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:20,127
Oh, Mr. Franklin?
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.

719
00:47:20,203 --> 00:47:23,969
Is it important?
Well, it could be.
You see, I was checking the, uh,

720
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,600
the phone company records
in San Diego.

721
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:31,339
Now, why would you want
to do that, Lieutenant?

722
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:35,544
Oh, well, I have to do that.
You know, that's part of my job.
I got to tie up all those loose ends.

723
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:37,677
Anyway,
on the day of the murder...

724
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,621
there was a record
of a call from the cabin.

725
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,421
It was a call to the Ferris house
in Los Angeles.

726
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:48,294
I see.
And now you're wondering whether
I can explain that. Is that right?

727
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:51,333
Oh, I'm sure you can.
Oh, you're right. I can.

728
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,767
But, you see, you would've saved
both you and me a great deal of trouble...

729
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:56,168
if you'd checked
with Joanna Ferris first.

730
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,730
She would've explained to you
that I'd spoken with her from my cabin,

731
00:47:58,808 --> 00:48:02,335
telling her thatJim and I had
patched up our differences.

732
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,346
Oh, what do you mean
by ' differences"? Uh...

733

But we all have
our dark sides, don't we?

to be alone with you in a small boat.

second thoughts about the money.

I wish
you hadrt said that, Lili.

hurts me deeply.

- It means that he knew her.

It means that he knew her
not casually, the way he said.

It means that he knew her

By itself,
it doesn't prove anything.

that Franklin committed these crimes,

Ken has an alibi.

932
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,572
What's his motive?

933
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,911
I told ya how he could've
worked the phone.

934
01:04:13,982 --> 01:04:18,248
Now, his motive
is the insurance money.
He needed cash.

935
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,118
He spent money like a drunken sailor.
He had two houses.

936
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,318
He's got paintings.
He's got women.

937
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,327
He's got...

938
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:29,593
What?

939
01:04:30,966 --> 01:04:33,025

Oh.

944
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,357
Lieutenant,
if Ken killed my husband,

945
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,795
then why did he murder
Miss La Sanka?

946
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:04,855
Well, it's my hunch
that she knew something.

947
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:07,766
Maybe she saw them together,
and she tried to blackmail him.

948
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:11,670
But that's pure guesswork, isn't it?
No, ma'am, it's not.
Not quite.

949
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:15,403
I checked the bank.
Yesterday, he took out $15,000.

950
01:05:15,477 --> 01:05:18,674
Today, he put it back in again.

951
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:21,147
Now, why in the world
would he do that?

952
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:27,314
All right.
I'm still not convinced, but...

953
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:29,983
let's say I'll go along.

954
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,286
What happens now?
I don't know.

955
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,958
But I've got a pretty strong
circumstantial case.
It's just not enough.

956
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:41,867
If I had one piece of hard evidence,
I could nail this fella.

957
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:47,704
But you don't.
That's right, ma'am. I don't.
That's why I'm here.

958
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,745
Maybe
you can give it to me.
Me?

959
01:05:50,812 --> 01:05:54,475
You knew both of these fellas very well.
I want you to tell me about 'em.

960
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:58,645
Anything. Just talk...
whatever comes into your mind.

961
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,247

01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,379
Not with the witness,
'cause you killed the witness.
But I got another way to prove it.

1019
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:55,754
Well, you enlighten me.
I must say, I enjoy watching a man raise
without any cards in his hand.

1020
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:59,021
You know what, Ken?
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1021
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:01,858
For a while there,
I never thought I was gonna get you.

1022
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,899
Believe me,
you had me goir in such circles.

1023
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:08,697
I couldn't figure it out.
Suddenly, I thought of something...

1024
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:11,170
how clever that first murder was...

1025
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:14,072
the phone gimmick,
working late in the office.

1026
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:16,804
<i>Brilliant.</i>
Oh, are you awarding gold medals today?

1027
01:10:16,878 --> 01:10:21,713
Yes! For the first one,
not for the second one.
That was sloppy.

1028
01:10:21,783 --> 01:10:24,081
Mrs. Melville,
she'd have been very disappointed.

1029
01:10:24,152 --> 01:10:26,279
<i>Oh, come on, get</i>
<i>to the climax, Lieutenant.</i>

1030
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:30,017
You're talking to a writer.
<i>Am I?</i>
<i>That's not what I heard.</i>

1031
01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:33,492
And that's the key:
That you're not a writer.

1032
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,963
When Mrs. Ferris told me
that you didn't contribute to the writing,

1033
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,023
that her husband did all the work,

1034
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,968
That's a lie.
I had to say to myself,

1035
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:47,134
'How could a man
with no talent for mysteries
make up such a clever murder?"

1036
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:50,666
<i>If you were that ingenious,</i>
<i>you'd be able to write your own books.</i>

1037
01:10:52,614 --> 01:10:55,549
Go ahead. I'm fascinated,
as boring as it may be.

1038
01:10:55,617 --> 01:10:57,642
Then I got it.

1039
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:01,678
The first one... the clever one...
that wasrt yours.

1040
01:11:01,756 --> 01:11:06,125
The second one...
the sloppy one... that was yours.

1041
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:09,595
- But not the first.
- Oh?

1042
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:12,792
And whose idea was that, then?

1043
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:15,802
Your partner's. Had to be.

1044
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,270
And his wife told me
how conscientious he was.

1045
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:23,073
You know, the way he used to write down
his ideas on every odd scrap of paper,
backs of matches, whatever...

1046
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:26,136
Ahh, ah. So that's why
you wouldn't let the movers in.

1047
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:29,945
Well, I had to rummage around here
before they emptied everything out.

1048
01:11:30,952 --> 01:11:32,943
Is this
your partner's handwriting?

1049
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:38,015
Well, I think I can prove it is.
Maybe I ought to read this to ya.

1050
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,790
'Idea for a Melville book...
perfect alibi.

1051
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:45,765
"A ' wants to kill 'B.'
Drives 'B ' to a remote house...

1052
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,859
'and has him call his wife in city.

1053
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:52,373
Tells her he's working late
at the office. Bang, bang."

1054
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:58,245
Sound familiar?
That's the part you used,

1055
01:11:58,313 --> 01:12:00,941
practically word-for-word.

1056
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:03,007
Should I read some more?

1057
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:07,111
No.
<i>[Door Opening, Closing]</i>
Officer.

1058
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:10,646
With this, I think I got
a conviction, don't you?

1059
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:18,063
You got to admit I had you goir
for awhile though, didn't I?

1060
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,567
Yes, you did.

1061
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:24,867
[Snickers]
You wanna know the irony
of all of this?

1062
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:28,306
That <i>is</i> my idea,

1063
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,867
the only really good one
I ever had.

1064
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:33,914
I must've told it toJim
over five years ago.

1065
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,916
[Chuckles]

1066
01:12:36,918 --> 01:12:40,115
Whoever thought that idiot
would write it down?
