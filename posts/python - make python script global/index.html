    <title>Make Python script globally executable</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Let's say I've got this one-line Python module called <code>say_hello.py</code>.</p>
    <pre>print 'Hello World'</pre>
    <p>How can I make the script executable from any location in my terminal?
      That is, having Hello World printed outside the Python interpreter
      anywhere on my system.</p>
    <p>First line of script should look something like:</p>
    <pre>#!/usr/bin/python</pre>
    <p>although the exact path may be different on your system.</p>
    <p>Then, make the script executable and put it somewhere in your PATH.</p>
