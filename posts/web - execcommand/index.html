       The 
       <small class="btn btn-success btn-xs">Green</small> commands are supported by your browser, where as the 
       <small class="btn btn-error btn-xs">Grey</small> ones.. You guessed it! :-) 
       <br>Anyway try to select contents below and click 
       <small class="btn btn-success btn-xs">commands</small> to execute the commands on it. 
       <br>I use the HTML attribute 
       <code>contenteditable=true</code> to allow modifications to the content. 
       <code>Updated</code>: Added

       <em>As pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/Robvanhe">@Robvanhe</a> the pen did not actually work in Safari. It was due to selection being cleared after click, so no selection to apply command existed. Fixed now. Rewritten also to vanilla javascript (no use for Angular).</em>
