   <h2>Calculating week numbers in JavaScript</h2> 
   <p>My customers require we create a date picker that they can choose a week and navigate back and forth. The week is identified by date range (start date - end date) and week number. We have to calculate the week number from a date.</p> 
   <h3>First week</h3> 
   <p>The ISO 8601 definition for week 1 is the week with the year's fist Thursday in it. The following definitions based on properties of this week are mutually equivalent, since the ISO week starts with Monday:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>It is the first week with a majority (4 or more) of its day in January</li> 
    <li>Its first day is the Monday nearest to 1 January</li> 
    <li>It has 4 January in it</li> 
    <li>It has the year's first working day in it, if Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are not working days</li> 
   </ul> 
   <h3>How to get the week number from a date</h3> 
   <p>The code below add two new functions to the Date object. To get the ISO week number (1-53) of a Date object, e.g <code>myDate</code>, use <code>myDate.getWeek()</code>. To get the corresponding four-digit year, use <code>myDate.getWeekYear()</code>.</p>
