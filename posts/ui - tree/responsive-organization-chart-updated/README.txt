A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/AldoFerrari/pen/raayXJ.

 A pure HTML/ CSS responsive organization chart with departments and sub-sections

Improvements:
- media queries are separated in one place only and not all over the css (more control on it)
- 3 new style of line (a 3 block column line; a 2 block column block line; a single block line)
- use SCSS to maange easly varaibles and breakepoint
- separated the list of departments from board area (more control and less ul insie ul inside ul inside ul)
- 7 column on the department area

inspired from [Ronny Siikaluoma](http://codepen.io/siiron/)'s Pen [Responsive Organization Chart](http://codepen.io/siiron/pen/aLkdE/).
