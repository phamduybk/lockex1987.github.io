      <p>Lyric Karaoke</p>
      <p>When I first see this effect on mp3.zing.vn, I'm really impressed. How
        can they do it? I think that they use text file (something like subtitle
        file). I search from Google, but very few answers. I already think to
        give up.</p>
      <p>But, sometimes I just can't give up. I try again with Firebug. And I
        get the encrypted lrc file. And I find the completed explication.</p>
      <p>You can do it with passion! It's fun. Sometimes it's useful too.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nhaccuatui.com/flash/xml?key1=bfbeb76fec35f13380027b9f8dcaa8a2">http://www.nhaccuatui.com/flash/xml?key1=bfbeb76fec35f13380027b9f8dcaa8a2</a></p>
      <p>Write your own lyric generator program (to create lrc file):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each word has individual time</li>
        <li>Show each line</li>
        <li>When you click, word is highlighted one by one</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can watch "Nguoi con gai khong the quen - Mr Siro" video to get the
        inspiration.</p>
      <p>Customize OSD Lyric program: text is changed a bit when running. This
        program is written in Lua language (yeah, rare).</p>
