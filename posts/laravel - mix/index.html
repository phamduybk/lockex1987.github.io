    <h1>Compiling Assets (Mix)</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix">Laravel Mix</a>
      provides a fluent API for defining Webpack build steps for your Laravel
      application using several common CSS and JavaScript pre-processors.
      Through simple method chaining, you can fluently define your asset
      pipeline. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');</code></pre>
    <p>If you've ever been confused and overwhelmed about getting started with
      Webpack and asset compilation, you will love Laravel Mix. However, you are
      not required to use it while developing your application. Of course, you
      are free to use any asset pipeline tool you wish, or even none at all.</p>
    <h2>Installation &amp; Setup</h2>
    <h4>Installing Node</h4>
    <p>Before triggering Mix, you must first ensure that Node.js and NPM are
      installed on your machine.</p>
    <pre><code>node -v
npm -v</code></pre>
    <p>By default, Laravel Homestead includes everything you need; however, if
      you aren't using Vagrant, then you can easily install the latest version
      of Node and NPM using simple graphical installers from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">their
        download page</a>.</p>
    <h4>Laravel Mix</h4>
    <p>The only remaining step is to install Laravel Mix. Within a fresh
      installation of Laravel, you'll find a <code>package.json</code> file in
      the root of your directory structure. The default <code>package.json</code>
      file includes everything you need to get started. Think of this like your
      <code>composer.json</code> file, except it defines Node dependencies
      instead of PHP. You may install the dependencies it references by running:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
    <h2>Running Mix</h2>
    <p>Mix is a configuration layer on top of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>,
      so to run your Mix tasks you only need to execute one of the NPM scripts
      that is included with the default Laravel <code>package.json</code> file:</p>
    <pre><code>// Run all Mix tasks...
npm run dev

// Run all Mix tasks and minify output...
npm run production</code></pre>
    <h4>Watching Assets For Changes</h4>
    <p>The <code>npm run watch</code> command will continue running in your
      terminal and watch all relevant files for changes. Webpack will then
      automatically recompile your assets when it detects a change:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run watch</code></pre>
    <p>You may find that in certain environments Webpack isn't updating when
      your files change. If this is the case on your system, consider using the
      <code>watch-poll</code> command:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run watch-poll</code></pre>
    <h2>Copying Files &amp; Directories</h2>
    <p>The <code>copy</code> method may be used to copy files and directories
      to new locations. This can be useful when a particular asset within your <code>node_modules</code>
      directory needs to be relocated to your <code>public</code> folder.</p>
    <pre><code>mix.copy('node_modules/foo/bar.css', 'public/css/bar.css');</code></pre>
    <p>When copying a directory, the <code>copy</code> method will flatten the
      directory's structure. To maintain the directory's original structure, you
      should use the <code>copyDirectory</code> method instead:</p>
    <pre><code>mix.copyDirectory('assets/img', 'public/img');</code></pre>
    <h2>Environment Variables</h2>
    <p>You may inject environment variables into Mix by prefixing a key in your
      <code>.env</code> file with <code>MIX_</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>MIX_SENTRY_DSN_PUBLIC=http://example.com</code></pre>
    <p>After the variable has been defined in your <code>.env</code> file, you
      may access via the <code>process.env</code>object. If the value changes
      while you are running a <code>watch</code> task, you will need to restart
      the task:</p>
    <pre><code>process.env.MIX_SENTRY_DSN_PUBLIC</code></pre>
    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>When available, Mix will automatically display OS notifications for each
      bundle. This will give you instant feedback, as to whether the compilation
      was successful or not. However, there may be instances when you'd prefer
      to disable these notifications. One such example might be triggering Mix
      on your production server. Notifications may be deactivated, via the <code>disableNotifications</code>
      method.</p>
    <pre><code>mix.disableNotifications();</code></pre>
