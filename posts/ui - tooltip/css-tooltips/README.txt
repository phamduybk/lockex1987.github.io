A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/peiche/pen/JaftA.

 Inspired by Andy Park's Pure CSS Tooltips pen, I took it one step further. Data attributes define the placement of the tooltip: left, right, top and bottom.

This pen served as the starting point for [Tippy.css](http://peiche.github.io/tippy.css/), my open-sourced pure CSS tooltip stylesheet. :)
