      <h2>HTML5 Audio Player</h2>
      <p><a href="demo.html" target="_blank">Demo</a></p>
      <p> Yes! The HTML5 audio tag with the "controls" attribute uses the
        browser's default player. You can customize it to your liking by not
        using the browser controls, but rolling your own controls and talking to
        the audio API via javascript. </p>
      <p> Luckily, other people have already done this. My favorite player right
        now is <a href="http://www.jplayer.org/"> jPlayer </a> , it is very
        stylable and works great. Check it out. </p>

      <h3> Introduction </h3>
      <p> Web developers have wanted to use audio and video on the web for quite
        a long time. With the standardization of HTML5 and most modern browsers
        starting to implement HML5, it’s been a great surprise for us. </p>
      <p> In the past, implementing audio and video in a web application would
        be very tedious since we would need to import heavy third-party plugins
        such as Flash. </p>
      <p> Now HTML5 audio/video provides another option for us, although it’s
        still not as powerful as Flash due to browser limitations. It is
        adequate in most cases. </p>
      <p> This article is going to tell you how to build your own HTML5 audio
        player. </p>
      <h3> Let’s start with a simple HTML5 player </h3>
      <p> <a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/1-3.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/1-3.png?resize=821%2C153&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <p> As seen in the above code, it will create a player using the default
        style that each browser provides. This means that the player will look
        different in different browsers. </p>
      <p> In Chrome: </p>
      <p> <a href="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/2-2-1.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/2-2-1.png?resize=379%2C63&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <p> In Firefox: </p>
      <p> <a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/3-2-1.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/3-2-1.png?resize=355%2C69&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <p> You might be thinking: “What if I wanted to style my own audio player
        with its own buttons and progress bar?” </p>
      <p> Actually, HTML5 provides quite a few useful APIs to make it possible
        to manipulate audio elements with JavaScript. This means that we can
        easily style our own player. </p>
      <p> So, first let’s get familiar with HTML5 audio tag attributes and some
        APIs we need to use in our demo. </p>
      <h3> Important tag attributes and JavaScript APIs </h3>
      <p> Tag attributes: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> buffered: Returns a TimeRanges object representing the buffered
          parts of the audio/video. </li>
        <li> controls: Sets or returns whether the audio/video should display
          controls (like play/pause etc.) </li>
        <li> currentTime: Sets or returns the current playback position in the
          audio/video (in seconds) </li>
        <li> duration: Returns the length of the current audio/video (in
          seconds) </li>
        <li> src: Sets or returns the current source of the audio/video element
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p> API events: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> canplay: Fires when the browser can start playing the audio/video </li>
        <li> canplaythrough: Fires when the browser can play through the
          audio/video without stopping for buffering </li>
        <li> pause: Fires when the audio/video has been paused </li>
        <li> play: Fires when the audio/video has been started or is no longer
          paused </li>
        <li> timeupdate: Fires when the current playback position has changed </li>
      </ol>
      <h3> Start building your player </h3>
      <p> <a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/4-1-1.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/4-1-1.png?resize=639%2C89&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <p> Now let’s start to customize our own audio player just like above
        picture shows. But before we start, let’s analyze it. Basically, this
        little player can be divided into the 5 following stories. </p>
      <ol>
        <li> It has a play/pause button, which is to start/pause the audio. </li>
        <li> If the user clicks the play button, audio will be started and it
          turns into a pause button. </li>
        <li> If the user clicks pause button, audio will be paused and it turns
          into a play button. </li>
        <li> It has a next button which is to switch to the next audio. </li>
        <li> It has a progress bar to track how much this audio has played. </li>
      </ol>
      <p> Now let’s implement our functions based on the above user stories. </p>
      <p> First of all, create the HTML5 markups. </p>
      <p> <a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/5-1-1.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/5-1-1.png?resize=870%2C538&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <p> Then write JS codes to make the player run! </p>
      <h3> For the first 3 stories, we can bind the below event to this
        play/pause button. </h3>
      <p> It utilizes the “paused” attribute, “play()” and “pause()” APIs, if
        the audio is paused. It then triggers play() and updates the button
        style, otherwise in reverse. </p>
      <p> <a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/6-3.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/6-3.png?resize=570%2C431&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <h3> For the 4th user story, we only need to update the source of the
        audio element. </h3>
      <p> <a href="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/7-3.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/7-3.png?resize=542%2C264&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <p> Regarding the last one, we need to grab the length of the current
        audio, and how much of it has played, to calculate the percentage and
        set the correct width of the progress bar. As we already learned,
        “duration” stands for audio length and “currentTime” represents how much
        audio has played. </p>
      <p> Add the below codes and you will see the progress bar is running! </p>
      <p> <a href="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/8-3.png?ssl=1">
          <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.perficient.com/files/2017/12/8-3.png?resize=821%2C302&amp;ssl=1">
        </a> </p>
      <h3> Retrofit your player </h3>
      <p> Finally, you can add the styles you like to make your play prettier. </p>

      <h3> Conclusion </h3>
      <p> I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about HTML5 audio and how you can
        create your own players. There are only basic controls in my player, but
        there’s nothing to stop you from adding more features such as volume
        control, play mode and even adding your own animations. I’m looking
        forward to seeing you create great HTML5 audio players! </p>
