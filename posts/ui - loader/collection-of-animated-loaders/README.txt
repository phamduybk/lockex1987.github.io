A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/pxnld.

 Inspired by [this article](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-collection-of-css3-animated-pre-loaders--cms-21978), except I've tried to create one element (no cheating with pseudos) versions. Not meant to reproduce the loaders in the article exactly and may have poorer browser support.
