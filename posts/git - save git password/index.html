		    <h2>Save git password</h2>
    <p>When I push sources from local to GitHub, it keep asking me for the
      username and password. It is very tedious.</p>
    <p>This tutorial will guide you to skip typing git password.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, from version 1.7.9 (released in late January 2012), Git has
      a credentials system that can help with this. Git has a few options
      provided in the box:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The default is not to cache at all. Every connection will prompt you
        for your username and password.</li>
      <li>The “cache” mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of
        time. None of the passwords are ever stored on disk, and they are purged
        from the cache after 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>The “store” mode saves the credentials to a plain-text file on disk,
        and they never expire. This means that until you change your password
        for the Git host, you won’t ever have to type in your credentials again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Find a helper: </p>
    <pre><code>git help -a | grep credential</code></pre>
    <p>Read its description:</p>
    <pre><code>git help credential-store</code></pre>
    <p>Tell git to use it:</p>
    <pre><code>git config --global credential.helper store</code></pre>
    <h3>Cache mode</h3>
    <p>Command:</p>
    <pre><code>git config --global credential.helper cache</code></pre>
    <p>Git will save your password in memory for some time. By default, Git will
      cache your password for 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds):</p>
    <pre><code>git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'</code></pre>
    <h3>Store mode</h3>
    <p>Command:</p>
    <pre><code>git config --global credential.helper store</code></pre>
    The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your
    username or password. For example:
    <pre><code>$ git config --global credential.helper store<br>$ git push http://example.com/repo.git<br>Username: &lt;type your username&gt;<br>Password: &lt;type your password&gt;<br><br>[several days later]<br><br>$ git push http://example.com/repo.git<br>[your credentials are used automatically]<br></code></pre>
            <p>Your passwords are stored in a plain file in your home
                directory. The default is ~/.git-credentials.</p><p>The content of the file:</p><p><code>https://lockex1987:PLAIN_PASSWORD@github.com</code></p>
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The password is not encrypted. It's just encoded by HTML URL Encoding, and can be decoded easily. Therefore, keep the file securely.</p>
